## Introduction
The Student Record System will collect the data of the students to create an accurate record of the students, from name, matric number, address, and more, that might be useful for any purpose in the future, namely, for education or emergency purposes. 

## Objective of Enhancement
- To enhance the system to become more usable.
- To clean the database from invalid data.
- To implement the security best practice in the web application.
## Input Validation
By doing validation on input forms, users will receive an error notification every time the data submitted does not match with the requirement from the system. This will ensure the data quality of the users.

## Authentication
We authenticate by using jsp and html, css form to authenticate students in our project.

## Authorization
## XSS and CSRF preventation
## Database security principal
 We are using the java as a middleman to connect to the database. Make use of java class to execute the query. The two java classes that embeded in the code is insert data and connector both are .java file.

## File Security principle
We separate the front end and back end part into the separate field and using the the valid file extension
